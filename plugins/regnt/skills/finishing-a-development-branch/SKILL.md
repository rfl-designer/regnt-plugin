# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Update SoloBoard → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
php artisan test --compact
vendor/bin/pint --dirty
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Update SoloBoard

If working on a tracked feature/task:

```
# Check timer status first — only stop if still running
timer-status
# If timer running: stop-timer task_id={ID} notes="Work completed"

update-feature feature_id={ID} status=done
update-task task_id={ID} status=done session_result="Summary of implementation"
```

**Note:** The calling skill (dev-workflow, ralph-loop) may have already stopped the timer. Always check `timer-status` first to avoid errors.

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main — is that correct?"

### Step 4: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** — keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>
php artisan test --compact    # Verify on merged result
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Log commits to SoloBoard and cleanup worktree (Step 6)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] `php artisan test --compact` passes
- [ ] `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` clean
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Then: Log commits to SoloBoard

```
log-commits task_id={ID} commits=[hashes] pr_url={PR_URL}
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6)

### Step 6: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1, 2, 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch | SoloBoard |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes | log-commits |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - | log-commits + PR |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | yes (force) | - |

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Skip SoloBoard status update

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Log commits to SoloBoard when applicable
- Update feature/task status

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **regnt:subagent-driven-development** - After all tasks complete
- **regnt:executing-plans** - After all batches complete
- **regnt:dev-workflow** - After delivery phase
- **regnt:ralph-loop** - After all stories complete

**Pairs with:**
- **regnt:using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
- **regnt:verification-before-completion** - Verify before any completion claim
